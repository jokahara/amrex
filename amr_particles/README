Particle propagation test of dccrg showing how to
store and use a variable amount of data in dccrg cells.
See the ../README file for information common to all tests.

simple_result.gif shows the expected result when visualized
with VisIt: Open simple_grid.visit then overlay
simple_particles.visit. Then click Add->Pseudocolor->cell
then select simple_grid.visit and click activate. Click
Add->Mesh->mesh and if VisIt asks about database
correlation answer yes. Double-click on Pseudocolor-cell
and change Point size (pixels) to 20. Finally click draw,
the result should be quite close to simple_result.gif.
