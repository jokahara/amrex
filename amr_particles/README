Particle propagation test using Amrex.
Compiling and running ./amrex inputs creates .vtk which can be visualized with VisIt.
For details on AMR, see Amr_notes.

Visualizing with VisIt: 
Open simple_grid.visit then overlay simple_particles.visit. 
Then click Add->Pseudocolor->cell then select simple_grid.visit and click activate. 
Click Add->Mesh->mesh and if VisIt asks about database correlation answer yes. 
Double-click on Pseudocolor-cell and change Point size (pixels) to 20. 
Finally click draw.
